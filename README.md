# MarketDLModels
The MarketDLModels repository on GitHub is a comprehensive collection of Python code and Jupyter Notebooks that are specifically designed to predict market movements using deep learning models. This project aims to explore the application of deep learning techniques in the financial markets and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in this field.

In this repository, we will be focusing on several key techniques that have proven to be effective in predicting market movements. These techniques include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and the TPU Research Cloud infrustructure.
