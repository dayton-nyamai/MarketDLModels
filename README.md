# MarketDLModels
The MarketDLModels repository on GitHub is a comprehensive collection of Python code and Jupyter Notebooks that are specifically designed to predict market movements using deep learning models. This project aims to explore the application of deep learning techniques in the financial markets and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in this field.

In this repository, we will be focusing on several key techniques that have proven to be effective in predicting market movements. These techniques include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and the TPU Research Cloud infrustructure. 

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network architecture that is particularly well-suited for time series data, such as financial market data. It is capable of learning long-term dependencies and has been widely used in various applications, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and, of course, financial market prediction. LSTM models have the ability to capture and remember patterns in the data over long periods of time, making them highly effective in predicting market movements.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNNs are a type of deep learning model that have been widely used in computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. However, they have also shown promise in analyzing and predicting sequential data, such as time series data. In the context of financial market prediction, CNNs can be used to extract relevant features from the input data, such as price patterns or technical indicators, and use these features to make predictions about future market movements.
